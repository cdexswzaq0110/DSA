/*
1. Problem Description:
Write a program based on the following requirements so that the output meets the specified criteria.
2. Program Requirements:
Implement a function named compute() that receives a midterm exam score from the main program. The compute() function should perform the following logic:
If the score is outside the range of 0 to 100, return -1.
If the score is greater than or equal to 60, add 5 points.
If the score is less than 60, add 10 points.
Return the adjusted score to the main program for output.
3. Input/Output:
Input:
A single integer representing the original score.
Output:
An integer representing the adjusted score.
Sample Input 1:
78
Sample Output 1:
83
Sample Input 2:
120
Sample Output 2:
-1
